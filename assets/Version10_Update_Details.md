# Version 10 of BatteryLife_Processed_Dataset update details

Thanks for the community’s support! Our BatteryLife project has been widely used in the past years and received some issues from the community (updated preprocessing scripts are already in this repo). 



At the beginning of 2026, we plan to release version 10 of the BatteryLife processed dataset to fix all issues in the past years and here are the updated details of this version 10:

1. Fixing the discharging column data of the datasets `XJTU`, `ZN-coin`, and `CALB`.
2. Updating the **life labels** of the datasets `XJTU`, `ZN-coin`, and `CALB`.
3. Fixing the wrong preprocessing operation for the dataset  `ZN-coin`, where we did not delete the first 9 formation cycles in the previous versions.



All updates have been released in both Zenodo and Huggingface websites.
